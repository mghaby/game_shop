# being able to go back if click on games instead of console or whatever 

# discount calcs are broken bc if @games is empty array nil cant + but if its 0 by default it cant
# have math done on it proper coz it uses 0 index in calcs


#  enter = fine
#  what to purchase should have checkout
## consoles / games / peripherals should have "go back option"
### if checkout is on 2nd loop get rid of the "would u like to purchase anything else thing"
